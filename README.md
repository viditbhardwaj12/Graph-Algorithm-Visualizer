# Graph-Algorithm-Visualizer 


## Draw your own graphs and visualize the most common graph algorithms

This web application allows you to draw a graph from zero, with possibility of directed and weighted edges, and visualize different algorithms for graphs known in CS.

## Features
- Draw a graph, with undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted edges
- Visualize multiple graph algorithms
- Keep your graph in JSON format text that can be used to recover the graph in any moment

## Built with
- Front-end - [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

## Algorithms
Currently it has 7 different algorithms
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Topological sort
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Bellman-Ford algoritm
- Kruskal
- Prim

Made in a way that is relatively simple to add more algorithms
